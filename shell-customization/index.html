			# Customizing your Linux command line

			---

			# Role of the Shell

			In linux, a shell is the program that interprets the commands you
			type and figures out what to execute. Many or most modern Linux-
			based operating systems assign `bash`, or the "Bourne-again shell"
			as the default user shell.

			### Common shells:

			* `sh` - Shell. Minimal but nearly universal.
			* `bash` - Bourne Again Shell. Basis for a lot of scripting.
			* `fish` - A highly customizable shell but not bash compatible.
			* `zsh` - Z shell. Fully bash-compatible and highly customizeable.

			---

			# Why customize the shell?

			For many linux power users, the shell is the primary interface to
			interact with the system. Certain operations or commands may feel
			clunky to different people, or the visual feedback may not be easy
			to read. These drawbacks can largely be aleviated by applying new
			themes to a terminal or by creating keybindings, aliases, or
			scripts.

			* **Terminal**: The graphical program that interfaces with a shell.
			* **Keybindings**: Key combinations that may execute commands or
			alter the state of the terminal without typing the commands.
			* **Aliases**: Binding a command input to transform to another
			command before executing.
			* **Scripts**: Programs that are interpreted by the shell and can
			run other programs, manipulate input and output, etc.

			---

			# Aliasing

			You can save a lot of time by just aliasing commands you frequently
			use to shorter command strings. The format for creating an alias in
			bash is `alias st="something"`.

			### Some useful aliases

			```bash
			alias ls="ls --color"         # Make ls print in color.
			alias sl="ls --color"         # Never lose time by misspelling "sl".
			alias l="ls -lah --color"     # Print extra file info, also in color.
			alias la="ls -lah --color"    # Print extra file info, also in color.
			alias ld="ls -ldh */ --color" # Print only directories, also in color.
			alias z="bg"                  # C-z pauses process, so z sends to background.
			alias ..="cd ../"
			alias ...="cd ../../"
			alias ....="cd ../../../"
			```

			---

			# Making aliases persist

			Just typing the `alias` command will work, but it won't persist
			past the current shell session. To make aliases apply to every
			shell session, we can edit the shell's initialization script.
			The init scripts are `~/.bashrc` for bash, `~/.zshrc` for zsh, and
			`~/.fishrc` for fish.

			One way to set up aliases is to create a `~/.alias` file, where
			each line is one alias command. Then you'd configure your shell
			init script to "source" that alias file, essenstially executing
			it as a bash script in the current shell session.

			```bash
			# .bashrc or .zshrc

			# Source ~/.alias if present
			if [ -f $HOME/.alias ]; then
				source $HOME/.alias
			fi
			```

			---

			# Creating a library of scripts

			Often you'll find that you can make a script to make your life a
			lot easier. If you set up a folder that you can just throw scripts
			into, then they'll be globally executable from the command line.

			Let's make that folder, as `~/bin`.

			In order to tell the shell that it should look at `~/bin` to find
			scripts or other executables, we have to add it to the PATH
			environment variable. The command to do so is
			`export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"`

			Again this has the problem of persistence. Just executing that line
			in bash will only apply it to one session. Instead, we can put that
			line in something like a `~/.path` file and source it as part of
			our shell init.

			```bash
			# In .bashrc or .zshrc

			# Source .path if present
			if [ -f $HOME/.path ]; then
				source $HOME/.path
			fi
			```

			# Zsh

			There are several reasons that many people prefer ZSH over bash,
			including better tab completion, extensive plugin support, extra
			themability, etc.

			Below are some snapshots of my zsh prompt.

			![Zsh snapshot](assets/zsh_blank.png)
			![Zsh snapshot](assets/zsh_dir_and_git.png)

			This uses the Agnoster theme from the oh-my-zsh plugin. Other
			themes from oh-my-zsh can be found
			[here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes)

			# Tmux

			Tmux stands for "terminal multiplexer" and allows for one terminal
			window to display several shell sessions, among other things. Tmux
			can split one window into several panes, stack multiple windows in
			a tabbed layout, or launch independent sessions.

			Cool things to do with tmux:

			* Detach/re-attach sessions (useful for sshing into servers)
			* Use panes on the same window for related tasks.
			* Use separate windows for less-related tasks.
			* Use tmux socket files to place two users in the same terminal.

			# SSH keys and configs

			When SSHing into a remote machine, you either need to type your
			user password, or you can opt to establish your identity using keys
			instead.

			SSH keys are cryptographic objects that exist in public/private
			pairs, where the private key belongs to the client and the public
			key is placed on a server. Cryptographically, the public key can
			be derived from the private key, but not the other way around.

			By placing a private key on your workstation and the matching
			public key on a server, you can establish secure authentication
			and remove the need to type your server password every time.

			---

			# Generating an SSH key pair

			Github has a good set of articles on generating SSH keys, so we'll
			defer there.

			[https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)

			Essentially, you'll end up with two files inside your `~/.ssh`
			folder, an `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. The one with .pub is the
			public key, the other one is the private key.

			**PROTECT YOUR PRIVATE KEY**. As the name key infers, it can be used
			to log in *as you* to any machine that has the matching public key,
			so don't give it to anybody.

			If you really want to share access to a server, tell the other
			person to generate their own ssh key pair and add their public key
			to the server as a specific user. That way, you can still restrict
			or remove their access to the machine in the future.

			---

			# Add the public key to a server

			For this step, you'll need to actually copy your `rsa.pub` file to
			the server you're accessing. You can use the following command to
			copy the file to the server:

			`scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub me@my.server.com:~/.ssh/`

			You'll need to manually enter your password for this, and you're
			still not done. You need to add the contents of that public key
			file to a special "authorized keys" file. To do that, ssh into the
			server, again manually entering your password (for the last time)
			and cd to `~/.ssh`. Then run `cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys`.

			The double arrow means to "append" the key, so any existing public
			keys in the file are not overwritten. From now on, when you ssh
			with your user to that machine, you won't need to enter your
			password (unless you specified a password when you generated the
			key itself).

			This also means that other programs that use the ssh protocol can
			now auth as you to that server. So if you add a remote git repo
			using the `git@github.com:you/your-project.git` format, you also
			won't need to type your password for pushing (or pulling from
			private repos).

			# Set up SSH hostname aliases

			So typing out `ssh nickm@shell.csh.rit.edu` every time I want to
			log onto ADA is a real pain. You can use the `~/.ssh/config` file
			to define shorthand host names.

			```bash
			# ~/.ssh/config

			Host csh
				Hostname shell.csh.rit.edu
				User nickm
			```

			Now I can simply run `ssh csh` and, in combination with the SSH
			keys I've put in place, be immediately logged into ADA.

			---

			# Managing configurations

			Since the beginning of the presentation, we've now added several
			configuration files for various purposes, such as .bashrc or
			.zshrc, .alias, .path, .ssh/config, maybe you've customized tmux
			with .tmux.conf, or you're a heavy vim user with your prized
			.vimrc. When you move to another machine it can be a real pain to
			set that all up again. The way I do it is by using a slight hack
			with git, something I found
			[on hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).

			The technique involves setting up a git repository to manage all of
			the "dotfiles". The `.git` repo folder can't go into your home
			folder, since it would overshadow every other git repo in any
			subdirectory. Instead, we use an alias trick to put the repo folder
			in a side directory, such as ~/.dotfiles.

			---

			# Git for dotfile management

			First init a git repo using `git init --bare ~/.dotfiles`

			Then we use an alias to specify separate repo and work-tree
			directories.

			`alias dot="git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME"`

			Finally, tell git to ignore every file unless we specifically ask
			it to track them, using `dot config status.showUntrackedFiles no`.

			Now we can use the alias `dot` exactly as we would use `git`, and
			manage the dotfiles. For example:

			```bash
			dot add .bashrc .zshrc .alias .path .tmux.conf .vimrc
			dot commit -m "Added initial dotfiles"
			dot push origin master
			```

			---

			# Deploying dotfiles to a new machine

			This git paradigm is mostly backwards from the standard usage flow.
			To get the dotfiles onto a new machine, we use
			`git clone --bare ~/.dotfiles`. Now, we manually add the alias from
			before to enable the `dot` command. This is where things reverse.

			Typically, we use git to save changes from the Working Directory
			as a new commit. In this case, we use commits to "unload" file
			state *into* the working directory (in this case, the homedir).

			All we have to do is say `dot checkout -f master`. Be careful,
			doing this will make git overwrite any files in the working
			directory that don't exactly match them in th repo.
