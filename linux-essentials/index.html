			# Linux Command-line Essentials

			---

			## Choose an environment

			### Ubuntu and Fedora

			Two popular and well supported linux distros, recommend
			dual-booting one of them for full linux capabilities.

			### Cygwin

			Not actually a linux distro, but rather a Windows-based linux
			compatibility platform. Workable, but might lack support for many
			programs.

			### Cloud 9

			Online IDE with a fully-functional Ubuntu container environment.
			Good for use from anywhere, but can only run command-line programs.

			---

			## What is the command line?

			A command line may also be known as a `terminal` or a `shell`. It's
			a program that executes other programs by interpreting commands.

			### What can a command line do?

			* Launch programs based on commands
			* Interact with executing programs
			* Print program output

			There's a common theme in the *nix world, "everything is a file".
			The most basic idea of a file is something that can take input and
			give output (i.e. reading/writing to a hard drive, network device,
			pipe, etc.). Linux shells are very good at manipulating files.

			---

			## Some basic commands

			### Moving around the filesystem

			```
			cd               # Change directory
			ls               # List
			```

			### Creating/deleting files and folders

			```
			touch <file>     # Creates an empty file
			mkdir <dir>      # Creates an empty directory
			rm <file>        # Removes a file or directory
			mv <src> <dest>  # Moves a file or directory
			cp <src> <dest>  # Copies a file or directory
			```

			### Data input/output routing commands

			```
			echo <something> # Prints arguments to standard out.
			cat <file>       # Prints the contents of a file to standard out.
			```

			---

			## Some shell operations

			Linux shells have the ability to reroute program inputs and outputs,
			meaning that once you get the hang of routing, you can do some
			sicknasty combos.

			```
			<command> | <command>    # Pipe. Output of first command goes into second command.
			<command> > <file>       # Right carat. Output of command goes into a file.
			<command> >> <file>      # Double right carat. Appends output to a file.
			<command> < <file>       # Left carat. Contents of file used as input to command.
			```

			Let's look at how we can use these symbols together with some of
			the commands we saw earlier.

			```
			$ echo "Hello!"
			  Hello
			$ echo "Hello!" > hello.txt   # Writes "Hello!" to hello.txt
			$ cat hello.txt
			  Hello
			$ echo "Goodbye" > hello.txt  # Writes "Goodbye" over hello.txt
			$ cat hello.txt
			  Goodbye
			$ echo "forever" >> hello.txt # Appends "forever" to hello.txt
			$ cat hello.txt
			  Goodbye
			  forever
			```

			---

			## Some cooler programs

			```
			grep <string>    # Searches for the given string in standard input.
			grep -r <string> <dir> # Searches for the string in any file in dir.
			find <dir> -name <name> # Finds files of the given name in dir.
			chmod
			chown
			pwd
			uname
			wget
			```
