			# What is Git?

			---

			## Git is a **Version Control System**

			Version control systems help to manage projects by keeping track
			of their history. Changes to a project managed by a VCS are called
			*"commits"*, and mark distinct points in history.

			---

			## Reporitories

			In most VCS tools, commits and other information are stored in a
			*repository*. In git, the actual repository is stored in the
			`.git/` subdirectory of your project. You shouldn't manually edit
			anything in `.git/` unless you know what you're doing; the `git`
			command manages that folder for us.

			<img src="assets/repository_diagram.png" style="height:50%;width:50%;"/>

			---

			## Working Directory

			Your working directory is where all of your project's files go.
			Your `.git/` repository lives inside your working directory, as
			a sibling to your project files.

			```bash
			...
			my_project/          # Working directory for my_project/
				.git/            # Repository
				src/             # Project files
				README.md        # Project files
				...              # Project files
			another_project/     # Working directory for another_project/
			...
			```

			---

			## Basic Commands

			A typical workflow with git involves the following commands:

			```bash
			# Info Gathering
			git status               # Prints the status of the local repo
			git diff                 # Prints all changes since last commit
			git branch               # Prints a list of local branches
			git remote               # Prints a list of known remote repos
			git log                  # Prints a history of commits

			# Basic Operations
			git init                 # Initializes a new empty repository
			git clone                # Copies an existing git repo
			git add                  # Stages changes from working directory
			git commit               # Commits staged changes
			git push                 # Pushes commits to a remote repo
			git pull                 # Fetches and merges commits from a remote repo

			# Harder Operations
			git checkout             # Switch to a local or remote branch
			git fetch                # Downloads commits from a remote repo
			git merge                # Merges specified branch into current branch

			# Advanced Operations
			git revert               # Adds a commit that undoes a previous commit
			git reset                # Moves the HEAD reference
			git rebase               # Combines branches/commits without merging
			```

			---

			## First project

			To initialize a new git repo, navigate to a new directory and
			type `git init`.

			```bash
			~$ mkdir project/
			~$ cd project/
			~/project$ git init
			```

			Congratulations, you now have a clean git repository. You can see
			it by typing `ls -la`, and check its status with `git status`.

			```bash
			~/project$ ls -la
			drwxrwxr-x  7 nick nick 4096 Jul  5 23:38 .git
			```

			```bash
			~/project$ git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
			```

			---

			## Making some changes

			In order to make use of your repo, we need to make some changes to
			the working directory. Let's create a new file with some text.

			```bash
			~/project$ echo "Hello, World" > hello.txt
			```

			Now if we look at our status, we'll see that git has found the new
			file.

			```bash
			~/project$ git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			Untracked files:
			  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

			      hello.txt

			nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
			```

			Untracked files are ones which git can see, but which are not part
			of the repository as of the latest commit.

			## Staging changes

			Before commiting files and changes to git's repository, we have
			to *stage* those changes. We do this using `git add`. There are
			several ways you can specify the files to change.

			```bash
			~/project$ git add hello.txt    # Stages only hello.txt
			~/project$ git add ./           # Stages all files in the current directory
			~/project$ git add -A           # Stages all files
			```

			Now if we look at our status, we'll see that the file has been
			successfully staged.

			```bash
			~/project$ git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			Changes to be committed:
			  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

			      new file:  hello.txt
			```

			## Git tracks changes, not files

			An important concept to understand about git is that git only cares
			about changes to the working directory. When we staged `hello.txt`,
			we told git to acknowledge the changes to `hello.txt` up to that
			point. Namely, that it had been created and had the contents
			"Hello, World". If we change the contents of the file while it's
			staged, then git will recognize that as a unique change.

			```bash
			~/project$ echo "Goodbye, World" > hello.txt
			~/project$ git status
			On branch master

			Initial commit

			Changes to be committed:
			  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

			      new file:  hello.txt

			Changes not staged for commit:
			  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
			  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

			      modified:  hello.txt
			```

			---

			## Using `git diff` to identify changes

			When editing project files, it's important to keep track of what
			you've changed. Git keeps track of which files have been changed,
			as well as which lines in those files have been added and deleted.
			Git diff can be told to compare between commits, files, and branches,
			as well as to look at staged vs unstaged changes. By default,
			`git diff` will show all unstaged changes.

			```bash
			~/project$ git diff
			diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
			index 3fa0d4b..db102ae 100644
			--- a/hello.txt
			+++ b/hello.txt
			@@ -1 +1 @@
			-Hello, World
			+Goodbye, World
			```

			If we want to take a look at staged changes, we can use
			`git diff --staged`.

			```bash
			~/project$ git diff --staged
			diff --git a/hello.txt b/hello.txt
			new file mode 100644
			index 0000000..3fa0d4b
			--- /dev/null
			+++ b/hello.txt
			@@ -0,0 +1 @@
			+Hello, World
			```

			---

			## Commit your first changes

			Since we have some changes in the staging area, we can commit those
			changes to git's history.

			```bash
			~/project$ git commit -m "This is my first git commit."
			[master (root-commit) f2db78b] This is my first git comit.
			 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
			 create mode 100644 hello.txt
			```

			Note: The `-m` flag on the commit command indicates that you want
			to write your commit message inline.
